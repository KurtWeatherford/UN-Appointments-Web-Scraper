# UN-Appointments-Web-Scraper

### Each time a member of the high-level UN staff is appointed, the Secretary General's Spokesperson puts out a short announcement on the folloeing webpage: https://www.un.org/press/en/un-bodies/appointments

### This tool is intended to scrape the most important information from each individual announcement (i.e. NAME, NATIONALITY, POSITION, DATE, ORGANIZATION, TERM).

### The program is not built to write to a CSV or any other file format, but such a function could be easially added.
